  <h2>Hi there!👋🏻 <br> This is Ekta Arora, a sophomore at <br> Chandigarh University </h2>
  <h1>My personal philosophy when it comes to education and learning is closely related to several cognitive theories of motivation. I believe that what goes on the classroom is my responsibility, and, by working with students, all of us can create an ideal environment for education, safety, understanding, and even fun. By keeping things positive, I believe that students will end up learning more and getting more out of each and every lesson.</h1>
